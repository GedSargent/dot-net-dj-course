Introduction to XML documentation comments


Comments are used to document what the program does and what specific blocks or lines of code do. C# compiler ignores comments.

To Comment and Uncomment, there are 2 ways
1. Use the designer
2. Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U

Note: Don't try to comment every line of code. Use comments only for blocks or lines of code that are difficult to understand
